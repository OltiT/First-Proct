				<h1>Movies</h1>
				<h3>A screenwriter writes a script, which is the story of the movie with dialogue and things that the actors will say and do.<br> A producer hires people to work on the movie and gets all of the money that will be needed to pay for the actors and the equipment.<br> Producers usually get the money by borrowing it from a bank or by getting investors to lend money to the movie production.<br> Some producers work for a movie studio; other producers are independent .<br>

Actors and directors read scripts to find out what to say and what to do.<br> The actors memorize the words from the script that they will say in the movie, and learn the actions that the script tells them to do. </h3>
